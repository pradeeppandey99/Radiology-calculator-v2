A calculator that can provide the manpower requirement for radiology dept based on following inputs:
1. Total no. of consultants
2. Total no. of registrars
3. Available manhours per month
4. Consultant time assumed for CT & MRI for those consultant's who have additional responsibilities
5. Resgistrar/Resident time assumed for CT & MRI reporting
6. Average reporting time - Simple CT (in mins)
7. Average reporting time - Complex CT (in mins)
8. % of Complex CT Work
9. Average reporting time - Simple MRI (in mins)
10. Average reporting time - Complex MRI (in mins)
11. % of Complex MRI Work
12. No of patients coming for CT per month
13. No of patients coming for MRI per month
14. % adjustment for seasonal variations

Based on above inputs, the calculator will calculate the following (formula provided):
1. Total available manhours per month= (no of consultants * consultant time assumed for CT & MRI for those consultant's who have additional responsibilities * available manhours per month) + (no of registrars * registrar/resident time assumed for CT & MRI reporting * available manhours per month)
2. Time required for simple CT reporting= (no of patients coming for CT per month*average reporting time*(1-% of Complex CT Work))/60
3. Time required for complex CT reporting= (no of patients coming for CT per month*average reporting time*(% of Complex CT Work))/60
4. Time required for simple MRI reporting= (no of patients coming for MRI per month*average reporting time*(1-% of Complex MRI Work))/60
5. Time required for complex MRI reporting= (no of patients coming for MRI per month*average reporting time*(% of Complex MRI Work))/60
6. Total time required for CT per month= Time required for simple CT reporting + Time required for complex CT reporting
7. Total time required for MRI per month= Time required for simple MRI reporting + Time required for complex MRI reporting
8. Total time required for reporting per month= Total time required for CT per month + Total time required for MRI per month
9. Adjusted total time required for reporting per month= Total time required for reporting per month * (% adjustment for seasonal variations/100)
10. Total Deficit or surplus of manhours per month= Total available manhours per month - Adjusted total time required for reporting per month
11. Total Deficit or surplus manpower required= Total Deficit or surplus of manhours per month/available manhours per month

Finally, the calculator will provide the manpower requirement:
1. Total deficit or surplus of manhours required
